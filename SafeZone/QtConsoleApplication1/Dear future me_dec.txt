	Dear future me,

	As you read this, i hope you find yourself in a state of fulfillment, having achieved many of your aspirations.
	By 2026, I imagine that you will have graduated from the military academy and will have obtained a good job. You also will have moved in a pretty apartment in Bucharest, near your job office that 
	This years I will develop my knowledge in cryptography and will be able to solve the hardest ctf problems. In my free time i will have a lot of fun making new friends and maybe I will travel a lot with my friends or family.
	In the years leading up to 2026, your hard work and dedication will have culminated in the achievement of your dreams.
	Wishing you a future filled with continued success, joy, and unforgettable experiences.

Warm regards,
Diana (2023)
